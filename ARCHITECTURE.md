**Never silently revise a past decision.** If a prior ADR turns out to be wrong or outdated, write a new ADR that explicitly supersedes it — the old one stays in the log with a "superseded by ADR-XXX" marker.

### ADR-001: Select Milvus as the primary range/threshold-query research backend

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-08-01
Risk level: HIGH
Evidence status: SUPPORTED for documented capabilities; INFERRED for comparative operational and reproducibility conclusions; no performance claim is VERIFIED until an EXP entry records local measurements.

Problem:

The Core scope requires one primary vector database backend for continuous range/threshold-query tuning under workload drift. The backend must expose correct threshold semantics, query-time controls that can be changed without rebuilding the index, a usable Python client, a reproducible local deployment, and enough experimental surface to measure recall/latency tradeoffs. Selecting the wrong backend would constrain the research question or introduce infrastructure noise into benchmark results.

Decision drivers:

1. Correct range/threshold-query semantics for L2, inner product, and cosine metrics.
2. Runtime tunability of HNSW search breadth (`ef`/`hnsw_ef`) and, where available, IVF probe count (`nprobe`) without index rebuilds.
3. Mature, scriptable Python client support.
4. Version-pinnable Docker deployment with controllable resource limits.
5. Research reproducibility: explicit independent variables, exact ground-truth path, low hidden state, and repeatable environment capture.
6. Per `AGENTS.md`: complexity, scalability, memory, latency, and research support.

Alternatives considered:

| Criterion | Option A — Qdrant | Option B — Milvus | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Range query support | `score_threshold` filters dense-search results by metric-aware score, but the query remains bounded by `limit`. | Explicit range-search parameters `radius` and `range_filter`, with metric-specific boundary rules; results are also bounded by top-K. | Milvus has the clearer first-class range/annulus model. Both require an explicit result cap, which the benchmark contract must record. |
| Runtime parameter tunability | `hnsw_ef` is supplied in per-query search parameters; changing it does not rebuild the index. Qdrant does not provide an IVF `nprobe` axis for its primary HNSW path. | HNSW `ef` is a search-only parameter; IVF `nprobe` is a search parameter in `[1, nlist]`. Both can vary per request without rebuilding. | Milvus provides two independent runtime tuning axes and supports comparison across HNSW and IVF families. |
| Python client maturity | Official `qdrant-client` supports synchronous and asynchronous clients with matching methods and provides a convenient local mode. | Official PyMilvus provides the synchronous `MilvusClient`; an async client exists, but its documented maturity and API coverage must be verified against the pinned server/client release. | Qdrant has the ergonomics edge. Both are adequate for a synchronous benchmark harness. Qdrant local mode must not substitute for server-mode benchmark evidence. |
| Docker setup complexity | One server container plus one persistent volume is sufficient for local server-mode experiments. | Standalone Docker Compose conventionally runs Milvus with etcd and MinIO, creating more services, volumes, health states, and resource variables. | Qdrant is materially simpler to operate and reproduce. |
| Research reproducibility | Fewer services reduce environmental variance; exact search can provide a ground-truth path. The main runtime ANN control is HNSW breadth. | More infrastructure must be pinned, but explicit range semantics, FLAT exact search, HNSW `ef`, IVF `nprobe`, and range-specific controls provide a richer controlled experiment surface. | Qdrant wins environment simplicity; Milvus wins construct validity and independent-variable coverage. Milvus is preferred because correctness and research validity outrank convenience. |
| Complexity | Low deployment and client complexity. | Medium deployment complexity and a broader parameter/index matrix that requires stricter experiment governance. | Qdrant advantage. |
| Scalability | Supports distributed deployment, but the Core study does not require multi-node operation. | Standalone supports the Core study and the architecture has a cluster path if later evidence requires scale-out. | No decision-driving advantage for Core; all Core experiments remain single-node. |
| Memory | HNSW graph and optional quantization create workload-dependent memory costs. | HNSW has graph overhead; IVF and FLAT provide alternative memory/performance profiles, while Milvus dependencies add baseline memory overhead. | No winner without measurement. Memory is a required benchmark response variable. |
| Latency | `hnsw_ef` exposes the expected recall/latency tradeoff. | HNSW `ef` and IVF `nprobe` expose recall/latency tradeoffs across two index families. | No performance winner is claimed before benchmarking; Milvus offers the broader tunable design space. |
| Research support | Official documentation supports threshold filtering, per-query HNSW breadth, and exact search. | Official documentation defines range search, HNSW search breadth, IVF probing, FLAT exact search, and a range-specific termination control. | Milvus better matches the Core experimental construct. |

Chosen solution:

Use **Milvus Standalone as the primary Core backend**, initially through the synchronous PyMilvus client. Start with two controlled index tracks:

1. `FLAT` for exact ground truth and semantic validation.
2. One approximate track at a time: HNSW with runtime `ef`, followed by IVF_FLAT with runtime `nprobe` only after the HNSW experiment contract is verified.

The exact Milvus, PyMilvus, Docker image, etcd, and MinIO versions must be pinned in the experiment environment before EXP-001. Automatic adaptation is initially restricted to per-query parameters (`ef` or `nprobe`). Index-build parameters such as `M`, `efConstruction`, and `nlist` require rebuilds and are not eligible for live automatic actuation under this ADR.

Reasoning:

1. **Correctness and research validity:** Milvus models the target operation directly with `radius` and `range_filter`, reducing semantic translation between the research question and the backend API.
2. **Experimental leverage:** runtime `ef` and `nprobe` offer distinct, falsifiable tuning dimensions without rebuild latency contaminating the online-adaptation loop.
3. **Ground truth:** FLAT provides an exact baseline within the same backend, reducing cross-system differences when calculating recall.
4. **Reproducibility:** Milvus has more operational variables than Qdrant, but they are controllable through pinned images, committed Compose configuration, fixed resources, health checks, seeded datasets, and recorded checksums.
5. **Tradeoff:** Qdrant is the better choice for minimum operational complexity, but convenience ranks below correctness and research validity in `AGENTS.md`.

Tradeoffs accepted:

- Higher local resource use and more failure modes from Milvus, etcd, and object storage.
- More version-compatibility work between server and PyMilvus.
- A larger index/parameter design space that must be constrained to prevent invalid cross-experiment comparisons.
- A result `limit` remains part of range-search semantics; experiments must treat threshold and result cap as separate workload variables.
- Qdrant remains an unimplemented fallback, not a second Core backend; multi-backend policy transfer remains Future Work.

Consequences for future modules:

- Define a backend port so workload generation, drift detection, policy logic, and metrics do not import PyMilvus types directly.
- Register `radius`, `range_filter`, `limit`, HNSW `ef`, and IVF `nprobe` in the Configuration Registry before policy actuation.
- Treat metric-specific threshold direction and boundary inclusion as contract-tested behavior.
- The safe actuation layer must retain the last-known-good per-query parameter set; rollback for `ef`/`nprobe` is a request-configuration restore, not an index rebuild.
- Keep index-build changes recommendation-only until a later ADR defines asynchronous rebuild, validation, cutover, and rollback.
- Do not mark the Milvus compatibility-matrix row verified from documentation alone; populate it only after direct integration tests.

Benchmark and validation plan:

1. Pin all container images and Python dependencies; record host CPU, memory limit, storage, Docker version, and configuration checksums.
2. Build a deterministic seeded dataset with an exact distance implementation independent of Milvus.
3. Verify L2 and cosine threshold boundaries against both the independent oracle and Milvus FLAT, including empty, all-match, threshold-equality, and result-cap cases.
4. Hold dataset, query stream, index build, resources, and result cap constant while sweeping HNSW `ef`; then repeat separately for IVF `nprobe`.
5. Confirm by index metadata and elapsed rebuild monitoring that runtime sweeps do not rebuild or replace the index.
6. Run repeated trials after cold and warm starts; record latency distribution, recall, QPS, memory, result cardinality, and run-to-run variance in `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`.
7. Do not freeze this decision until the smoke benchmark and failure tests pass with raw output reviewed.

Rollback plan:

- Before data or backend-specific code becomes production-critical, preserve Qdrant as the fallback candidate behind the same backend port.
- If Milvus fails semantic contract tests, cannot vary `ef`/`nprobe` without rebuild, or produces unacceptable run-to-run variance after resource pinning, write a superseding ADR selecting Qdrant.
- No dataset migration is required during Phase 1: regenerate the versioned benchmark dataset from its source manifest and seed.

Modules affected:

Backend adapter; benchmark harness; workload monitor; tuning policy; safe actuation layer; configuration registry; experiment environment.
